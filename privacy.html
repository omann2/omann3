              <p>
                Personally identifiable information of registered securities
                representatives and advisors is primarily derived from the
                Securities and Exchange Commission's Investment Adviser Public
                Disclosure (IAPD) database and can be found in the Central
                Registration Depository. Only the licensed representative's or
                advisor's name, firm affiliation, city, state, and ZIP code are
                disclosed in a basic listing. This basic information is provided
                to allow for a user to accurately identity a licensed
                representative or advisor and review his or her services.
                advisor-registry.org is not responsible for the accuracy of any
                information. All other information found in listings available
                to users through our website is supplied voluntarily and
                knowingly made accessible to the public by the licensed
                securities representative or advisors themselves who has updated
                his or her professional listings. With the exception of a name
                and state which cannot be removed by the representative or
                advisor, licensed professionals interacting with our website may
                delete other information, or modify information found in their
                professional listings on advisor-registry.org. This includes
                their firm affiliation, address, telephone number, email
                address, credentials or other personally identifiable
                information. Professionals that update their listing constitute
                their acceptance that advisor-registry.org may share such
                information with users of this website, its partners and agents
                for purposes related to the advisor-registry.org's products and
                services, including for the purpose of contacting them via email
                about products and services that may be of interest to them.
                Users may visit our website without telling us who they are or
                revealing any personally identifiable information about
                themselves.

                <b
                  >3.&nbsp;I am a registered securities representative or
                  advisor. But how do I get my name removed from your site?</b
                ><br />If you are currently licensed, we will not remove your
                name. If you are unhappy with negative reviews, we will not
                remove your name either. Your basic licensing information is
                made available to everyone to protect the public. We respect
                your privacy and do allow you to remove or modify all personal
                content with the exception of your name and state which you
                cannot remove on your own. However, if you have given up your
                license and you are no longer regulated by the securities
                industry or you have changed professions, we will remove you
                permanently from the directory upon written request. Please use
                the contact form on the "Contact" page. YOU MUST STATE CLEARLY
                THAT YOU NO LONGER ARE A REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE OR ADVISOR.

                <b
                  >4.&nbsp;What if I see a review and rating that I think should
                  be removed? Can I have a review removed?</b
                ><br />A review will not be removed just because it is a low
                rating. However, bogus reviews, whether good or bad, will be
                removed. Inappropriate reviews will also be removed. Reviews
                written by the professional, by their employees or agents will
                be removed. If you think a review of yours should be removed,
                feel free to write to us and tell us why it should be removed.
                We will consider your request but cannot guarantee we will agree
                with you. The best way to combat one or two bad reviews is to
                ask dozens of your satisfied clients to write reviews.
              </p>

                <b
                  >5.&nbsp;I'm going to pose as a client and review myself
                  numerous times to increase my overall rating.</b
                ><br />NEVER WRITE A REVIEW OF YOURSELF OR HAVE AN EMPLOYEE
                WRITE A REVIEW OF YOURSELF. We are on the lookout for those
                self-serving reviews. We use humans, not machines to detect and
                remove phony reviews. But more importantly, it is a violation of
                current law. Posing as a client or hiring an outside agency or
                employee to post positive ratings is a practice known as
                "astroturfing", and is prohibited.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b
                  >6.&nbsp;One of these reviews is false and it's hurting my
                  professional practice! I want to send you a letter demanding
                  that it be removed.</b
                ><br />We do not accept demand letters because it is not our
                role to determine whether a review is true or false. You might
                dispute the truth of a review, but your disputing it does not
                make it false.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b
                  >7.&nbsp;If you won't accept a demand letter, I have no choice
                  but to sue you!</b
                ><br />The Communications Decency Act (CDA) is a complete bar to
                our liability for the statements of others on this website: "No
                provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be
                treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided
                by another information content provider." 47 U.S.C. § 230.
                Federal courts have applied this standard on its terms: "By its
                plain language, Section 230 creates a federal immunity to any
                cause of action that would make service providers liable for
                information originating with a third-party user of the service."
                Zeran v. AOL, 129 F.3d 327, 330 (4th Cir. 1997). The ratings on
                this site are written by our users, not by our company. Thus,
                under the CDA, we are not the "publisher or speaker" of the
                ratings, even if they contain false information and we are not
                liable for defamation, libel, fraud or any other tort claim you
                might bring.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b
                  >8.&nbsp;I think my demand letter would put you on notice that
                  the review is false and defamatory. That makes you liable.</b
                ><br />No, it doesn't. Zeran, 129 F.3d at 227, and the cases
                following it uniformly hold that it is not up to us to determine
                whether your demand letter is correct or the review is correct.
                The CDA gives us complete immunity for the statements that
                others make on this site.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b
                  >9.&nbsp;But you lost your CDA immunity by aggregating the
                  user ratings into an average!</b
                ><br />No. The most instructive case on aggregate ratings is the
                California Court of Appeals' decision in Gentry v. eBay, which
                squarely held that such ratings do not transform a publisher
                into an information content provider. 99 Cal. App. 4th 816, 834
                (Cal. App. 2002).
              </p>
              <p>
                <b
                  >10.&nbsp;But you lost your CDA immunity by editing the
                  rater's original comments!</b
                ><br />No. Under 230(c)(2)(A), "No provider or user of an
                interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of
                any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to
                or availability of material that the provider or user considers
                to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent,
                harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such
                material is constitutionally protected".
              </p>
              <p>
                <b
                  >11.&nbsp;I'm going to sue you anyway. Taking down the review
                  is cheaper than paying a lawyer.</b
                ><br />Sounds like a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public
                Participation (SLAPP)! Twenty-eight states, including our home
                state, have passed strict anti-SLAPP laws, authorizing expedited
                motions to dismiss and giving rise to counterclaims seeking
                attorneys' fees and liquidated damages.
