                <p>Access to and use of Advisor-Registry.org's services, including the "Ask an Advisor" Program, is provided subject to the following Terms and Conditions Agreement. Your use of Advisor Registry's services constitutes your acceptance of these terms and conditions.</p>
                <h3>Terms and Conditions Agreement</h3>
                <p>Before using this service, you should carefully read the following terms and conditions. Information on this site is provided for informational purposes and is not meant to substitute for the advice provided by your own financial advisor. By using the Advisor-Registry.org service, you accept the terms and conditions below.</p>
                <p>This Agreement describes the terms and conditions applicable to your use of the Advisor-Registry.org service (the "Service"). We may amend these terms and conditions at any time by posting the amended terms on our site. The amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted on our site. This Agreement may not be otherwise amended except in a writing signed by both parties. For the purposes of these terms and conditions "user(s)" means any person or entity that accesses or uses the Service, including, but not limited to, financial advisors and their clients.</p>
                <p>Because we do not and cannot be involved in user-to-user dealings (be they professional engagements or mere communications) in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with these disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code section 1542, which states: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor".</p>
                <h3>Information and Accuracy</h3>
                <p>For legal reasons, we cannot nor do we try to control the information provided by other users that is made available through our system. You release us from any and all liability with respect to information entered on or through Advisor-Registry.org that is offensive, harmful or inaccurate.</p>
                <p>We have no control (and we will not seek to establish control) over the truth or accuracy of a user's postings or content on the Advisor-Registry.org website and Service. Advisor-Registry.org assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings.</p>
                <h3>User Communications and Content</h3>
                <p>You understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials ("Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person or entity from which this Content originated. This means that you, and not Advisor-Registry.org, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email or otherwise transmit via the Service. Advisor-Registry.org does not control the Content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of this Content.
